# ImmersiveFirstPerson
Minecraft mod to render the player model in first person
Tested on NeoForge 1.21 only
Feel free to DM me on discord (stasis_the_shattered) for any questions or suggestions

This is my first published mod after only ~1 month of modding experience, but I tried my absolute hardest to make it the best I can.
There are some small bugs and incompatibilties I have to fix, but the mod is pretty much fully working.

What I am aware of, and actively working on fixing:<br/>
  -Camera is very jittery when getting near walls (but, it's at least better than clipping).
  -Fishing rod line does not render properly when riding certain entities (and boats when using Not Enough Animations).
  -Going from crawling/swimming/gliding to standing upright lets you momenterily see the body.
  -Showing hat/helmet (disabled by default) does not offset in front of camera correctly. This one is a huge pain, but I do eventually want to fix it.
  Please let me know anything else that is broken, or any improvements that could be made!

Why does this mod exist when there is already a very popular, well-known first person mod?
  -Short answer: I wanted to improve some aspects of it for my own personal use, and use it as a learning experience.
  -Long answer: Some things really bugged me about that mod, mostly the camera position and the swimming. The swimming animation in this mod always displays the arms in front of you no matter your rotation. The camera is also highly customizable in all 3 directions (no 
  rotation, yet?). I just hated how your EYES would rotate, not your whole head, and it really ruined the immersion for me. 
  With that being said, the other mod is made by a very talented creator and made much better than mine, so go check it out as well! (if you somehow haven't already)

Does this mod support other popular mods, such as Not Enough Animations?
  I have not done extensive testing, but from my experience NEA does not seem to break anything other than the fishing line.
  As far as other mods go, anything that simply adds animations using the *vanilla* system should work fine. Mods that change the camera, or have their own player animation system may not work. 
  If your mod does not work, I will look into it and try to add compatibility, if possible.

Will there be compatibility for other mod loaders?
  It is planned, but as I only have experience with NeoForge, it will not be for a bit. It should be a fairly straightforward process, so I definitely will get around to it at some point.
