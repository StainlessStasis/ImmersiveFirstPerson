This is my first published mod after only ~1 month of modding experience, but I tried my absolute hardest to make it the best I can.<br/>
<br/>
## IMPORTANT UPDATE:<br/>
I've decided that I want to work on other projects and will likely not be working on this mod anymore, unless it is a very important bugfix or something. I don't plan to update it to new versions, or add support for other mods or mod loaders. However, the mod is (and has always been) MIT license, so do whatever you want with the source code. I know it ain't much, but thanks to the few hundred of you who downloaded and tried out my first mod. See you in the next project.<br/>
## Why does this mod exist when there is already a very popular, well-known first person mod?<br/>
  -Short answer: I wanted to improve some aspects of it for my own personal use, and use it as a learning experience.<br/>
  -Long answer: Some things really bugged me about that mod, mostly the camera position and the swimming. The swimming animation in this mod always displays the arms in front of you no matter your rotation. The camera is also highly customizable in all 3 directions (no 
  rotation, yet?). I just didn't like how your EYES would rotate, not your whole head, and it really ruined the immersion for me.<br/>
  With that being said, the other mod is made by a very talented creator and made much better than mine, so go check it out as well! (if you somehow haven't already)<br/>
<br/>
## Problems I'm aware of:<br/>
  -Fishing rod line does not render properly when riding certain entities (and boats when using Not Enough Animations).<br/>
  -Camera is still slightly buggy/jittery when colliding with blocks.<br/>
<br/>
## Does this mod support other popular mods, such as Not Enough Animations?<br/>
  I have not done extensive testing, but from my experience NEA does not seem to break anything other than the fishing line.<br/>
  As far as other mods go, anything that simply adds animations using the *vanilla* system should work fine. Mods that change the camera, or have their own player animation system may not work.
